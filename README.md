# word

An application designed to help Chinese programmers learn computer vocabulary.

#the reasons for designing the app

For many of the Chinese programmers,english is an essential limit to be outstanding in coding. As all of the programming languages are written in engligh and created by people who speach English, understanding programming vocabulary provide a way to get access to original and high quality tutorails.

#the core method in memorising vocabulary of the app

As we all know,an English word usually has several meanings in Chinese,which is difficult for us to memorise. When we look the several meanings of a same word harder, we will find the several meanings have a lot in common. I presume it is an efficient way to memorise word for us Chinease.

#the progress

The app is still being developed~~~and it will be completed soon.

```

const abc = 666;

```
